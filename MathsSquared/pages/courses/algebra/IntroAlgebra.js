        </div>
        <p>
          Algebra is a branch of mathematics dealing with symbols and the rules
          for manipulating those symbols. Those symbols (today written as Latin
          and Greek letters) represent quantities without fixed values, known as
          variables.
        </p>
        <h5>The use of letters</h5>
        <p>
          In algebra, you will see the a lot of letters being used. The letter
          represents a value which we don't know. It's better to use letters
          than to leave it empty as it gives a visual representation of what we
          need to find out.
        </p>
        <p>
          If there are several 'unknowns', then we can use different letters for
          each value. And it doesn't have to be x, it could be y, a ... or any
          letter or symbol we like but in algebra, x is used the most and is
          standard for the first 'unknown' variable.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h5>How to solve</h5>
        <p>
          Algebra is just like a puzzle where we start with something like 'x âˆ’
          6 = 5' and we want to end up with something where 'x = 11'. But
          instead of saying 'x = 11', it's better to use a step-by-step
          approach.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Work out what to remove to get x on it's own.</li>
          <li>
            Remove it by doing the opposite (adding is the opposite of
            subtracting and multiplying is the opposite of dividing)
          </li>
          <li>Do that to both sides of the equation.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Here is the example:</p>

        <h5>Why do we do it to both sides</h5>
        <p>
          Whatever you have done to one side of the equal sign, it <b>must </b>
          be done on the other side. This is because you must keep the equation
          equal and make sure to keep it balanced.
        </p>

        <h5>A problem</h5>
        <p>Attempt to solve this problem.</p>
        <b>
          <div className="text-center" style={{ fontSize: "x-large" }}>
            X + 4 = 11
          </div>
        </b>
        <p>We want to have X on it's own where 'X = ...'</p>
        <p>
          To get X on it's own, we need to subtract both sides by 4 (because 4 -
          4 = 0)
        </p>
        <p style={{ marginLeft: "150px" }}>
          So let's begin by subtract 4 to both sides: X + 4<b>- 4</b> = 11
          <b>- 4</b>
        </p>
        <p style={{ marginLeft: "412px" }}>So: X + 0 = 7</p>
        <p style={{ marginLeft: "333px" }}>
          This becomes: <b>X = 7</b>
        </p>
        <br />

          With algebra, you are always able to check your answers by simply
          subsituting your answer back into the equation.
